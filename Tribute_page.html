            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Full Name:</strong>    Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</li></li>
                <li> <strong>Recoginised As:</strong> Missile Man of INDIA & 11<sup>th</sup> President of INDIA</li>
                <li><strong>Early life and education: </strong> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on <strong> 15 October 1931 </strong> to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.</li>
                <li><strong>Career as a scientist:</strong> 
                    After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation <i> (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India)</i> as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.</li>
                <li><strong>Presidency: </strong>Kalam served as the 11th President of India, succeeding <strong> K. R. Narayanan</strong>. He won the 2002 presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. <strong> His term lasted from 25 July 2002 to 25 July 2007</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-presidency: </strong>After leaving office, Kalam became a visiting professor at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, and the Indian Institute of Management Indore; an honorary fellow of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.</li>
                <li><strong>Death: </strong>On <strong> <i> 27 July 2015</i></strong>, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest.[84] At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life. Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m IST. His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"</li>
