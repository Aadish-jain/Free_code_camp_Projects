<b> User Story #1:</b> The Tribute page should have an element with a corresponding <i> id="main"</i>, which contains all other elements.

<b> User Story #2:</b> I should see an element with a corresponding <i>id="title"</i>, which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").

<b> User Story #3:</b> I should see a div element with a corresponding <i>id="img-div"</i>.

<b> User Story #4:</b> Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding <i>id="image"</i>.

<b> User Story #5:</b> Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding <i>id="img-caption"</i> that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.

<b> User Story #6:</b> I should see an element with a corresponding <i>id="tribute-info"</i>, which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.

<b> User Story #7:</b> I should see an a element with a corresponding <i>id="tribute-link"</i>, which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").
